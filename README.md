## Stop wasting your time
Are you tired of always configuring project by yourself?
Or maybe you always search for npm package that will create it for you? But still they lack features you need or can't give you enough customization.
*Project wizard* will create any project you can think of with **simple** console ui.
Every possible project configuration goes with example, that will include everything that your project has.
