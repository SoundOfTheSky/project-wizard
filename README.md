## Stop wasting your time

Are you tired of constantly setting up a project yourself?

Or maybe you are always looking for a package that will create it for you? But they still lack the features you need, or they can't provide you with enough customization.

The project wizard will create any project you can think of using a simple console interface.

Every possible project configuration is accompanied by an example project.
